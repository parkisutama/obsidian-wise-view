# Wise View

> **A focused, task-management-agnostic view enrichment plugin for Obsidian Bases.**

Wise View adds Calendar, Swimlane, Gantt, and Timeline views directly into Obsidian Bases — without
any opinion about *how* you manage your tasks or which plugin you use for that.  Your data model is
yours. This plugin just gives you richer ways to look at it.

## Origin & Attribution

This plugin is a **derivative work** of [Obsidian Planner](https://github.com/SawyerRensel/Planner)
by [Sawyer Rensel](https://github.com/SawyerRensel), which is licensed under the
**GNU General Public License v3.0**.

Because the original work uses GPL v3 — a *copyleft* license — this plugin **must also be distributed
under GPL v3**. See the [License](#license) section for details.

### What was changed from the original

The original Planner is a full-featured planning and task management plugin. Wise View intentionally
**narrows the scope**:

| Original (Planner) | Wise View |
| --- | --- |
| Task List view | ✗ Removed |
| Item Modal / Quick Capture | ✗ Removed |
| Natural language date parsing (chrono-node) | ✗ Removed |
| Recurrence engine (rrule) | ✗ Removed |
| Item hierarchy & blocking dependencies | ✗ Removed |
| Task management workflow & statuses | ✗ Removed |
| Calendar view | ✓ Kept |
| Kanban view | ✓ Kept, renamed **Swimlane** |
| Gantt view | Added (an earlier Frappe-based view was replaced) |

### Gantt code attribution

The Gantt view incorporates code adapted from
[obsidian-bases-gantt](https://github.com/lhassa8/obsidian-bases-gantt) by
Lars Tray ([lhassa8](https://github.com/lhassa8)), licensed under the **MIT License**.

The MIT License is compatible with GPL v3: MIT code may be included in a GPL v3 project, and the
whole project is then governed by GPL v3. The original MIT copyright notice is preserved in the
[LICENSE](LICENSE) and [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) files as required.

## Features

- **Calendar view** — Month, Week, Day, and List layouts. Open and navigate your dated notes at a
  glance. See the [Calendar View documentation](docs/calendar-view.md).
- **Swimlane view** — Drag-and-drop board with columns and optional swimlane rows. You choose
  the property for columns (and rows); nothing is preselected. Formerly named "Kanban"; renamed
  because Obsidian now ships a core Kanban view.
- **Gantt view** — Phase-aware schedule built on
  [@jaeungkim/gantt-chart](https://github.com/jaeungkim/gantt-chart). Parent notes and native Bases
  grouping become phases, finish-to-start dependencies are drawn and edited on the chart, and
  moving, resizing, progress, links, order, and note creation are written back to your properties.
  Blocking and date conflicts are derived from Depends on. See the
  [Gantt documentation](docs/gantt-view.md) for goal-based recipes and option relationships.
- **Timeline view** — Grouped, virtualized date ranges plus quick placement of unscheduled notes
  into user-selected start/end properties, with no task-schema assumptions. See the
  [Timeline View documentation](docs/timeline-view.md).

All views are **Obsidian Bases-native**: they use your selected frontmatter properties directly and
introduce no hidden task schema.

---

## Requirements

- Obsidian **1.10.0** or later (requires Bases API)
- Desktop is supported.
- Mobile is enabled (`isDesktopOnly: false`) and should be treated as best-effort until Android
  and iOS testing is complete.

---

## Installation

### Manual (for development / testing)

1. Run the production build:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm run build
   ```

2. Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` to your vault:

   ```text
   <Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/wise-view/
   ```

3. Enable the plugin in **Settings → Community plugins**.

### Community Plugin Store

Submission to the Obsidian community plugin store is planned once the plugin reaches a stable
feature set.

---

## Usage

Open any folder as a Base (right-click → **New base from folder**), then select the view type
dropdown to **Calendar**, **Swimlane**, **Gantt**, or **Timeline**.

### Recommended frontmatter shape

Wise View does not enforce a schema. Any dated frontmatter works. Common example:

```yaml
---
title: Website Redesign
status: In Progress
priority: High
date_start: 2026-03-01
date_end: 2026-03-31
progress: 40
---
```

---

## Platform support

Wise View is designed for Obsidian desktop and does not use Electron-only runtime APIs in the
plugin source. Mobile support is enabled for beta testing, but complex Calendar, Swimlane, Gantt, and Timeline
interactions may need platform-specific testing on Android and iOS.

---

## Privacy and data handling

Wise View reads and writes notes through Obsidian's vault APIs. It does not use network requests,
telemetry, analytics, account sign-in, payments, ads, or files outside your vault.

---

## Upgrading

### Kanban view renamed to Swimlane

The Kanban view is now the **Swimlane** view, and its view type changed from `wise-view-kanban`
to `wise-view-swimlane`. Bases created with the old view no longer find it. Update each `.base`
file that uses it:

```yaml
views:
  - type: wise-view-swimlane # was: wise-view-kanban
```

Views no longer preselect properties. Choose **Columns by** (the board shows a prompt until you
do), and **Title by**, **Color by**, **Cover field**, and **Summary field** if you want them; an
unset title shows the file name. In Calendar, **Title field** is empty by default (file name) and
all-day events come from the new **All-day field** option instead of a fixed `all_day` property.

---

## Migrating from the earlier Gantt view

The Frappe-based Gantt view was replaced. Its view type (`wise-view-gantt`) is reused, so a base saved with
it opens in the new **Gantt** view; there is nothing to convert by hand.

- **Your settings are imported once**, on first open: start, end, label, dependencies, parent, progress,
  color by, view mode, task list, note template and folder, and the "move dependent tasks" policy. A notice
  says how many were imported.
- **The chart is read-only until you turn off "Read only"** in the view options. The old view wrote on
  drag; Gantt asks first. Dependencies stay in the same property.
- **Not carried over:** expected progress, bar height, the Hour / Quarter day / Half day scales (imported as
  Day), the right-click menu, the WBS sidebar (replaced by the task list and phases), the Gantt
  command-palette commands, and the "Gantt defaults" settings.
- If you tried a development build with view type `wise-view-gantt-beta`, change that type to
  `wise-view-gantt` in the `.base` file; the beta id was never released.

## Known limitations

- Wise View requires the Obsidian Bases API, so older Obsidian versions are not supported.
- Gantt is read-only until you turn off **Read only** in its view options. Once editing is on, it
  writes dates, progress, Depends on, Parent, and Order only to the properties you mapped, and only
  when you drag, draw, or edit in the view.
- Gantt has not been verified on mobile or in a popout window, and keyboard editing is untested.
  Drags may not work in a popout window (a limitation of the chart library).
- Calendar date changes write only to the mapped frontmatter properties when you directly create,
  drag, or edit an item in the view.
- Mobile support is best-effort until tested on Android and iOS.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the plugin does not load, confirm `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` are in
  `<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/wise-view/`.
- If the view types do not appear, disable and re-enable Wise View in **Settings → Community
  plugins**.
- If a Base shows no entries, confirm your notes have values in the configured frontmatter
  properties.
- If you are testing a local build, run `pnpm run build` before copying release artifacts.

---

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Watch mode (rebuilds on save)
pnpm run dev

# Production build
pnpm run build
```

The build output is `main.js` at the project root.
